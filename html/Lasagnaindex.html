                <p>
                    <ui>
                        <li> Lasagna Noodles: This recipe uses regular (not no boil) lasagna noodles. </li>
                        <li> Adds flavor to the sauce. </li>
                        <li> Ground Beef: My go-to for a lasagna meat sauce. If desired, you can add 1/2 pound of Italian sausage along with the ground beef. The Italian sausage will add even more flavor. </li>
                        <li> Garlic: You can’t beat the flavor of fresh garlic! </li>
                        <li> Marinara Sauce: You’ll need 48 ounces (two 24-ounce jars) of store-bought sauce. If you want to use homemade marinara sauce, you’ll need 6 cups of sauce. </li>
                        <li> Salt, Pepper and Italian Seasoning: These add the perfect amount of seasoning to the lasagna. You can also add a pinch or two of red pepper flakes for a bit of heat. </li>
                        <li> Fresh Parsley: Brightens up the flavors; you can omit it if you don’t have any on hand. </li>
